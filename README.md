## Installation and Running Tutorials
Running these tutorials locally requires installing and loading the `learnr` package, with the following lines of code:

```{r}
install.packages("learnr")
library(learnr)
```

To then manually install the most recent version of the `tutorials281`, you must first ensure you have the latest version of devtools installed:

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```
Then, run the following code:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("isabel-laterzo/tutorials281")
library(tutorials281)
```
You can then run individual tutorials on your local machine by running the following line of code:

```{r}
learnr::run_tutorial("TUTORIAL_NAME", package = "tutorials281")
```
Tutorials correspond to the name of each subfolder within the `inst` directory.
