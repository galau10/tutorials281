## Welcome

In this tutorial, you will start getting oriented with R. We will practice some basic math, learn about a few key concepts (e.g., objects), and begin to learn about "commands".

If you are ready to begin, click below!



## Topic 1: Math in R

Let's start off by becoming acquainted with R and basic commands. 

First, it is important to know what a **command** is. Commands are also commonly referred to as **functions**. You will commonly hear your instructor and others use both of these terms. A **command** is a directive or order that you give to a computer program to perform a task. Commands are issued via the R Console - either by directly typing them in the console or terminal (bottom left in the image below), or by writing them in the source editor in an R Script (top left, image below) and executing them in the console. An R script is a document that you can save with all of your code to run in the future.

Below, we're going to first learn how to use R in its basic form. We will then move on to some basic commands and learn about command syntax.

In your console and in the source editor, you can perform basic math. For example, below, the R code executes the command 2 + 2.

```{r two-plus-two, exercise = TRUE}

2 + 2  #add two plus two

```

Note that to execute this line of code, you can click "Run" or "Run Code". But, more effectively, you should get used to running lines of code by clicking Command + Return.

Further, note here that next to the code, I included a `#` symbol along with some text which explains what that line of code is doing. This practice is called **commenting** your code, and is very important. In R, if you use the `#` symbol, everything you type following the symbol will not be recognized by R as code. Rather, you can include there text or formulas to provide some context to your code, explain what you are doing, or organize a document. Doing so is particularly useful as your code becomes more complicated. You will see comments used throughout this tutorial and throughout R documents that you receive in this class. In your own code, make sure to comment as well! You will thank yourself in the future. 


### Basic Math {data-progressive=TRUE}

Beyond addition, we can also work with other operators. Here is a list:
  
* Addition `+`
* Subtraction `-`
* Multiplication `*` (an asterisk)
* Division `/`
* Exponents `^` (where 4 to the second power would be `4^2`)


Note that R always follows the order of operations, so make sure to review good ole PEMDAS and make sure to use parentheses when necessary.

Below, practice dividing 4 by 1.5:
  
```{r math_ex1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r math_ex1-hint-1}
# use the / operator
```
```{r math_ex1-hint-2}
4/1.5
```

We can also combine operations. For example, see the below code which multiplies the sum of 2+2 by the result of 4 divided by 1.5.

```{r combo_math, eval = T}

(2 + 2)*(4/1.5) 

```


Now you practice! Below, multiply 2 by 10 and divide the result by 3

```{r math_ex2, exercise = TRUE}

```
```{r math_ex2-hint-1}

# You will want to use (), *, and / operators here!

```
```{r math_ex2-hint-2}
(2*10)/3
```


### Useful Math Commands {data-progressive=TRUE}

In addition to the math we just practiced, there are math-related commands (aka functions) that use a slightly different format. Here, we will learn about our first command -- `sqrt()` -- which calculates the square root of a number. 

All commands follow a general syntax. Each command has a name - in this case, it is `sqrt` which helps us to identify the command. If you want to learn more about the command, in your R console you can type `?` before the command name and press Enter. That will return the "help file" for that command, which gives you information about its name, what it does, and what the inputs are. For example, if I type `?sqrt()` into R, I will see the following in the bottom right "help" panel.


![Help File in R](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/drive-viewer/AAOQEOTLkNueMrXTpnBgy2taq4bXLlbC9bDah8f4G68Ojv2EdXfmJRbjJ4gO7xGE16EmqXSFsLy0YwXoAIDEQRNd_dJZZjvEOg=s1600){width=100%}


After the name, commands are followed by parentheses. Within these parentheses, commands accept **arguments**. For some commands, this is quite straightforward and they only accept one argument. For example, with the `sqrt()` function, the only argument it accepts is **x**, what the help file states should be "a numeric or complex vector or array". For now, we'll just give it one number and see what happens.

```{r sqr_nine, eval = T}
sqrt(9)
```


We could also be slightly more complex, and give it an equation of interest. R will then calculate the result of that equation, and subsequently calculate the square root. For example, if we want to calculate the square root of `2*6` we would do the following:
```{r sqr_mult, eval = T}
sqrt(2*6)
```


Some commands accept more than one argument within the parentheses. We will cover these in future weeks. 


Within R, there are some additional and similar basic math functions. For example, we can use `abs()` to calculate the absolute value of a number. This works in the same was as `sqrt()` -- you should place the number or equation of interest into the parentheses.

For example, the below code calculates the absolute value of 5 (which is just 5!).

```{r abs_5, eval = T}
abs(5)
```


You try! Below, calculate the absolute value of -8.
```{r math_ex3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r math_ex3-hint-1}
abs(___) #fill this in
```
```{r math_ex3-hint-2}
abs(-8)
```


## Topic 2: Objects

Say you want to save something in R for future use within your code. You can do so by creating an **object**. If you are familiar with other coding languages, some refer to objects as **variables**. Objects store information in R -- whether that be a single number or a full data frame, in addition to other types of data that we will learn about in this class. 

Today, we will begin by assigning basic numbers to objects. To do so, we will use the `<-` operator. In the below code, the number 1 is stored as an object called `object1` using the `<-` operator. 

```{r}
object1 <- 1
```

Note that it is not *necessary* to include a space before and after `<-`. However, it is strongly suggested, as it can create errors in your code when it becomes more complicated. See that the below code works just as well without spaces.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
object1<-1 #no spaces

object1 #return the object
```

It is also important to note that when you create an object, you need to explicitly **return the object** (or type out the object name, and run that line of code) to see its contents. For example, if I just assign the number 1 to `object1` below, it will save, but I will not see the result. You can also check out the value in your Global Environment (type right panel in R Studio).

```{r, eval = TRUE}
object1 <- 1 #assign to object 1
```

However, if I want to then see the number which I assigned to `object1`, I would have to do the following:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
object1 <- 1 #assign to object 1

object1 #return the object
```

With this all in mind, it is now your turn to practice! Create an object called `birth_year` where you save the number corresponding to the year you were born.

```{r birthyear, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r birthyear-hint}
birthyear <- ______ #fill this in with your birth year
```


Further, you can name objects almost anything you want! With some exceptions:

* You **cannot** name an object a number on its own. For example, an object cannot be named `2011`, but it could be named `year_2011`
* You **cannot** name an object with a symbol on its own. For example, an object cannot be named `__`, but it could be named `year__`


```{r, eval = TRUE}
2011 <- 2011 # see error

year_2011 <- 2011 # but this works!

```


In sum:

* The spaces between `object1` and `<-` are not necessary, but that is best practice. 
* In order to see the contents of an object, you must explicitly return that object
* You can save objects as *almost* anything! It can be `object1`, `object2`, `cat`, `anything`. But you cannot use numbers or symbols on their own.



### Objects don't have to be numbers!

Objects can also be text, but we have to wrap the text in quotation marks. For example, see below:

```{r, eval = T}

object2 <- "Hi there!" #save Hi there! in object

object2 #return the object

```


Now you try, save your name into an object called `my_name`.

```{r obj_ex3, exercise = TRUE}

```
```{r obj_ex3-hint-1}

my_name <- ____ #put your name here

```
```{r obj_ex3-hint-2}

my_name <- "YOUR NAME HERE"

```


In class this week, we will also be learning about a third class of data -- Booleans or logicals -- which can also be combined into vectors using the `c()` command. 


### We can combine objects and arithmetic

If we are using numerical objects we can also execute mathematical operations with these objects. For example, in the blow chunk of code, I am adding together two fictional percentages of party affiliated voters in a state. I create an object called `republicans` which is equal to 45 and an object called `democrats` which is equal to 55. I then add then together. 

```{r, eval = TRUE}

#create initial objects
republicans <- 45
democrats <- 55

#add them together
total_voters <- republicans + democrats

#return the result
total_voters

# I could also just add them together without saving them as an object
# but then this value is not saved
republicans + democrats

```

Now you try! 

In the below chunk of code, do the following:

* Create an object called `days_rain` which captures the number of days that rained in a town. Set this object equal to 70.
* Create an object called `days_no_rain` which captures the number of days that it did NOT rain. This should be equal to 295 (365 days - 70 days)
* Then, subtract `days_rain` from `days_no_rain` and save this into an object called `rain_diff`
* Return the value of `rain_diff`

```{r obj_ex4, exercise = TRUE}




```
```{r obj_ex4-hint-1}

#create initial objects
days_rain < - ___
days_no_rain <- ___

#create new object for difference
_____

#return difference
_____
```
```{r obj_ex4-hint-2}

#create initial objects
days_rain < - ___
days_no_rain <- ___

#create new object for difference
rain_diff <- _____ - _____

#return difference
rain_diff
```
```{r obj_ex4-hint-3}

#create initial objects
days_rain < 70
days_no_rain <- 295

#create new object for difference
rain_diff <- days_no_rain - days_no_rain

#return difference
rain_diff

```




## Topic 2: Vectors

**Vectors** are an important building block of databases and data frames. A vector is a type of object, just like we created before, but it involves **MULTIPLE** elements. Vectors are very useful because they can end up serving as either a row or a column of a database.

Vectors can contain numbers, characters, and other data types we will learn about.

### The `c()` command

An essential command to create vectors is the `c()` command, which stands for "combine" or "concatenate". `c()` does just that -- it allows us to combine elements to create a vector. This is the first command that we will use that takes multiple "arguments" or elements that go within the parentheses. With `c()`, you place in the parentheses all of the elements you wish to combine into one vector, and separate each element using a comma. 

For example, the below chunk of code uses the `c()` command to combine four numbers to create a vector called `first_vector`.

```{r, eval = TRUE}

first_vector <- c(1, 5, 6, 8) # create the vector
first_vector # return the vector to see output and ensure it worked

```


Note that vectors can also combine non-numerical elements. As we did before, when we are dealing with characters, we have to use `" "` to make sure R knows these are character elements. For example:

```{r, eval = TRUE}

second_vector <- c("I", "love", "political", "science") # create the vector

second_vector #return the vector

```


Now you practice! Create your own numerical vector called `my_vector` and give it 4 numbers of your choice.

```{r vec_ex1, exercise = TRUE}

```
```{r vec_ex1-hint}
my_vector <- c(__, __, __, __) #include four numbers of your choosing
```


Now do this again, but create a vector called `my_name` and fill it with your name. Give it one element for each of your names. For example, if you name is Lucy Dacus, you would have one element for "Lucy" and one for "Dacus". But, if your name is longer -- maybe Whitney Elizabeth Houston -- you would have one element for "Whitney", one for "Elizabeth", and one for "Houston". If your name is Madonna, it would just be "Madonna".

```{r vec_ex2, exercise = TRUE}

```
```{r vec_ex2-hint-1}
my_name <- c(___, ___) 
```
```{r vec_ex2-hint-2}
my_name <- c("Your", "Name", "Here")
```


## Topic 3: Math with Vectors

Now that we are able to create vectors, we can also do math with vectors. The below video will walk you through how we can perform mathematical operations with vectors.


<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MjwJM-HRMPg6D8hPzMh3aQKInDeJyPga/preview" width="640" height="480" allow="autoplay"></iframe>


Below, we'll walk through that example again and you can execute the provided code.

First, we'll take a look at our two vectors with information on the number of protests that occurred across three towns in 2015 and 2016. I want to know the total number of protests in each town for these two years.


```{r protest, exercise = TRUE}
# create my vectors
protest_15 <- c(5, 10, 8)

protest_16 <- c(2, 7, 3)

```

With this information, we can then add these two vectors together:

```{r protest_add, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "protest"}

protest_15 + protest_16

```

Note that we can also save the result of this addition as its own vector:

```{r protest_add2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "protest"}

sum_protest <- protest_15 + protest_16 # save the object

sum_protest # return the result

```



### Practice

Your turn! Now you will be tasked with creating two vectors and performing some calculations with them. Let's imagine you have information about two political science classes at UNC. You have the percentage of students present in each of these classes from Monday --> Friday. 
Create two vectors with the following information:

* `class1` - Mon. 80%, Tues 95%, Weds.90%, Thurs 98%, Fri 88%
* `class2` - Mon. 82%, Tues 96%, Weds. 88%, Thurs 90%, Fri 80%

NOTE: Do not include the `%` sign when you are creating these vectors. Just type the number corresponding to the percent (e.g., 88 for 88%).

Then, calculate the difference in attendance between class 1 and class 2 for each day of the week. Save this in an object called `class_diff`.

Below, some initial code has been provided to you to help you out. Use this code as a starting place to complete this task.
 

```{r class_ex, exercise = TRUE, eval = F}
# create two vectors first
class1 <-
  
class2 <-


# then calculate the difference for each day

____ <- _____ + ______

```

```{r class_ex-hint-1}

# start with this 
class1 <- c(______)
class2 <- c(______)

```

```{r class_ex-hint-2}

# start with this 
class1 <- c(______)
class2 <- c(______)

# then subtract

class_diff <- _______-

```
```{r class_ex-hint-3}

# start with this 
class1 <- c(80, 95, 90, 98, 88)
class2 <- c(82, 96, 88, 90, 80)

# then subtract

class_diff <- class1 - class2

```



## Topic 4: Naming Vectors

Now that we have objects with multiple elements, it can also be useful to name those elements. This can help us keep track of the information a little bit better. For example, let's return to the example of protest. We are tracking the number of protests across three towns/cities in the years 2015 and 2016. But before, we didn't label those cities by name. But, we can do this, using the `names()` function. See below to see how it works


```{r, eval = TRUE}
# first create my vectors
protest_15 <- c(5, 10, 8)
protest_16 <- c(2, 7, 3)

# now, use the names function to give these two objects names
names(protest_15) <- c("Chapel Hill", "Durham", "Raleigh")
names(protest_16) <- c("Chapel Hill", "Durham", "Raleigh")


#create a new object and add them together
total_protest <- protest_15 + protest_16

#return that object - what do you see with the numbers now?
total_protest
```

When you now return the object, you will see that each element of the vector will have these names - Chapel Hill, Durham, and Raleigh. 

Since we have two objects which we are giving the same names, we can also save those names in a separate character vector, and do the following:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# first create my vectors
protest_15 <- c(5, 10, 8)
protest_16 <- c(2, 7, 3)

# now, use the names function to give these two objects names
cities <- c("Chapel Hill", "Durham", "Raleigh")

names(protest_15) <- cities
names(protest_16) <- cities


#create a new object and add them together
total_protest <- protest_15 + protest_16

#return that object - what do you see with the numbers now?
total_protest
```


Now you try naming a vector! Create a vector corresponding to the number of NCAA men's basketball wins with the following information. Store the number of wins in a vector called `wins_men`. Then name each element of the vector with the appropriate school's name.

* UNC - 6 wins
* Duke - 5 wins
* NC State - 2 wins

```{r bball_ex, exercise = TRUE}
# create the vector
wins_men <- _____


# then name the vector

names(_____) <- _________

```
```{r bball_ex-hint-1}

# create the vector
wins_men <- c(______)


# then name the vector

names(____) <- c(_______)

```
```{r bball_ex-hint-2}

# create the vector
wins_men <- c(6, 5, 2)


# then name the vector

names(wins_men) <- c("UNC", "Duke", "NC State")

```



## Topic 5: Selecting an Element of a Vector

Vectors are objects which store multiple elements of data. While this is great, it is important that we are still about to select certain elements, or parts, of those vectors. We will learn about this more in depth in class, but will provide an introduction and some practice here. 

The most basic way to select an element is by indexing a vector, either using:

1. The name of that element
2. The physical place of an element in a vector (e.g., it is the first or second element)


So, for example, let's revisit that vector you created with the number of men's basketball NCAA champsionships. Say we want to isolate how many wins UNC had. We can select that element using square brackets, or `[]`. See below

```{r mens_bball, exercise=TRUE, eval = TRUE}
# create the vector
wins_men <- c(6, 5, 2)
# then name the vector
names(wins_men) <- c("UNC", "Duke", "NC State")


# select UNC's wins by name
wins_men["UNC"]


# select UNC's wins by element number
wins_men[1]

```

You can also select multiple elements! If you want to do this, you will have to use the `c()` command within the `[]`. See below for how we would select *both* UNC and Duke wins.


```{r mens_bball2, exercise=TRUE, eval = TRUE, exercise.setup = "mens_bball"}

# select UNC and Duke's wins

wins_men[c("UNC", "Duke")]

# or

wins_men[c(1, 2)]
```



Typically, it is recommended that you select a vector element by a name. That is because you sometimes will be dealing with vectors that have so many elements that it is unreasonable to know where exactly one element is located. However, it is important to know how to select by number as well, as this will come in handy.

### Practice Selecting Elements

Now, you try! We will now take a look at the NCAA women's basketball teams that have one the most championships. Create a new vector called `wins_women` which has the number of wins for the following schools.

* UConn - 11
* Tennessee - 8
* Baylor - 3
* Stanford - 3
* South Carolina - 2
* Notre Dame - 2

Name this vector such that each element correspond's to its school name. Then, using `[]`, show the following information:

1. How many wins did Notre Dame have?
2. How many wins did Notre Dame AND Baylor have?
3. How many wins did the fifth school (fifth element) have?

You have been given some code below to get you started. Fill in the code as necessary to answer these questions.


```{r bball_ex2, exercise = TRUE, eval = F, error= F}
# create the vector
wins_women <- c(___)

# then name the vector
names(wins_women) <- c("___", ___, ___, ___)


# How many wins did Notre Dame have?
wins_women[___]


# How many wins did Notre Dame AND Baylor have?
wins_women[c(___,___)]


# How many wins did the fifth school (fifth element) have?
wins_women[_____]


```
```{r bball_ex2-hint-1}
# create the vector
wins_women <- c(11, 8, 3, 3, 2, 2)
# then name the vector
names(wins_women) <- ("UConn", "Tennessee", "Baylor", "Stanford",
                      "South Carolina", "Notre Dame")

# How many wins did Notre Dame have?
wins_women[___]


# How many wins did Notre Dame AND Baylor have?
wins_women[c(___,___)]


# How many wins did the fifth school (fifth element) have?
wins_women[___]


```
```{r bball_ex2-hint-2}
# create the vector
wins_women <- c(11, 8, 3, 3, 2, 2)
# then name the vector
names(wins_women) <- ("UConn", "Tennessee", "Baylor", "Stanford",
                      "South Carolina", "Notre Dame")

# How many wins did Notre Dame have?
wins_women["Notre Dame"]


# How many wins did Notre Dame AND Baylor have?
wins_women[c(___,___)]


# How many wins did the fifth school (fifth element) have?
wins_women[___]


```
```{r bball_ex2-hint-3}
# create the vector
wins_women <- c(11, 8, 3, 3, 2, 2)
# then name the vector
names(wins_women) <- ("UConn", "Tennessee", "Baylor", "Stanford",
                      "South Carolina", "Notre Dame")

# How many wins did Notre Dame have?
wins_women["Notre Dame"]


# How many wins did Notre Dame AND Baylor have?
wins_women[c("Notre Dame","Baylor")]


# How many wins did the fifth school (fifth element) have?
wins_women[5]


```
